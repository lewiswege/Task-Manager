<h1> Task Manager Web-App </h1>
<h2>A simple task manager application as my final project</h2>
    <p>This is a research project to improve my problem solving and time management skills</p>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>FastAPI for the Back-End<li>
        <li>AJAX for asynchronous HTTP Requests<li>
        <li>HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the Front-End<li>
        <li>JSON for data storage<li>
        <li>Hash Table Data Structure<li>
    </ol>

<p>The application allows users to add tasks to a task queue and delete them when they need to</p>

<p>The app uses API routes to perform CRUD operations which make the entire application work.</p>

<p>JavaScript is also incoporated in the app to handle the frontend logic. This handles the request of the task queue and updates the UI dynamically whenever the user refreshes the Tasks or adds new ones to the queue</p>

<p>FastAPI is the technology that does all the magic, it handles the API endpoint and also handles the rendering of the application's UI</p>

<p>Clone the repo from your terminal move into the root of the repo and run the application through the following command</p>

<strong>uvicorn app.main:app --reload</strong>
